# Turtle and Car Game

<h2>How to Play : </h2>
<ol>
<li>Run the game by executing the main Python script.</li>
  <br>
<li>Use the "Up" key to move the turtle forward, trying to avoid colliding with the cars.</li> 
    <br>
<li>When the turtle reaches the top edge of the screen without colliding with a car, you level up, and the car speed increases.</li>
    <br>
<li>
If the turtle collides with a car, it's game over, and the game stops.
    <br>
</li>
  <br>
  <li>
    You can restart the game by running the script again.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Controls : </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Press the "Up" key to move the turtle forward.</li>
   <br>
    <li>Press the "ESC" key to exit the game.</li>
  </ol>
 <h2>Game Logic :</h2>
    <p>
      The turtle can only move forward, not backward, left, or right. Cars are
      randomly generated along the y-axis and move from the right edge to the
      left edge of the screen. When the turtle reaches the top edge of the
      screen, you level up, and the car speed increases. A collision between the
      turtle and a car results in a game over.
